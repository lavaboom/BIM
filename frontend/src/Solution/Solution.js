/*

Following a team meeting, you were asked to create a table to display
building data from a newly written endpoint (see backend /buildings/all route)

Just as you are about to go home, the team leader adds:
"I want to be able to filter data by company name"

You have the freedom to solve the problem in any way you want.

(OPTIONAL) Use the MaterialUI table: https://mui.com/material-ui/react-table/
We are currently using this table in our product.
However, use of this library is optional in this assignment.

const Solution = () => {
    return <>
        <h1>This is my table.</h1>
    </>
